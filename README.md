# V2 starter
The default Gatsby starter for V2.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

I'm experimenting Gatsby V2. I'm using this to teach myself about the following:

1. StaticQuery (Component level GraphQL)
2. Two types of page creation.  I want to site pages from md files and separately a blog from a second set of md files.
3. CSS inlining and splitting
